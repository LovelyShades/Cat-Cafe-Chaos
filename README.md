Cat Café Chaos is a 3D simulation game built in Unity 2022 LTS (URP).
Players manage a bustling cat café — serving customers, petting cats, and cleaning up messes before chaos takes over.

This project is part of a portfolio showcase demonstrating C# scripting, gameplay systems design, and Unity engine proficiency.
