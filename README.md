🐾 Cat_Cafe_Chaos – Unity Game Showcase






Cat Café Chaos is a 3D simulation game developed in Unity 2022 LTS (URP).
Players take on the role of a café owner managing a lively cat café — balancing time, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction while dealing with playful feline chaos.

This project is part of a portfolio showcase demonstrating gameplay systems design, Unity development, and UI integration.
